# Amazon_Pet_Supplies_Review_Text_Classification_And_Sentiment_Analysis
As more and more businesses are incorporating or exclusively offering online products and services, the product reviews have become critical method of receiving customer feedbacks. Consumers are posting reviews directly on companies’ products pages in real time.  With the vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity for everyone to see how the market reacts to a specific product type. The dataset that was utilized for this project is Dr. Jianmo Ni’s (professor at University of California San Diego) “Amazon Review Data (2018)” dataset from Github(https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The full dataset has over 230 million number of reviews and the dataset includes data from May 1996 to October 2018. I worked on a smaller sub-set, per-category data on “Pet Supplies Review” .
